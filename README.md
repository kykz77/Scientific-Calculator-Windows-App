# Scientific-Calculator-Windows-App
 Hello! Welcome to my scientific calculator project!

 After my scientific calculator broke, I had to resort to the windows calculator. However, I unfortunately did not really like some of its features, hence, I've created an improved version to use on my laptop, and I thought it would be good to share, so not everyone has to resort to using the windows calculator!

 Essentially, its an alternative to the windows calculator, with improved features such as multiline display, the ability to do multiple operations together in one line, and storage of previous answers. 

 Enjoy!
